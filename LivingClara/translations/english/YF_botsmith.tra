@0    = ~What's this? The Delryn Family Shield? *rolls eyes* But he can't even use it now, can he? Hah...~
@1    = ~If we take an iron rod corrupted for centuries by an ancient vampire's evil aura to forge a new handle for it, plus 50,000 gold... then it can be reforged... *sneer* At least enough for him to hold it again. So, what do you say?~
@2    = ~All the components are ready. I'll start reforcing this shield. What? We still have to keep this coat of arms on it? Tsk... Fine. Gotta keep up the "honorable" appearances, right? Heh heh...~
@3    = ~Not interested. Maybe we should look at something else.~
@4    = ~Maybe? Who knows! But I can afford to keep looking...~
