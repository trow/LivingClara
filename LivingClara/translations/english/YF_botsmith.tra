@1    = ~If we take an iron rod corrupted for centuries by an ancient vampire's evil aura, combine it with adamantine dust to forge a new handle, plus 10,000 gold... then it can be reforged...*squint*At least enough for him to hold it again. So, what do you say? Let me be clear, the gold is for the solvent, not for my own pocket.~

@4    = ~Maybe? Who knows! But I can afford to keep looking...~
