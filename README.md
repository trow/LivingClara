# Living Clara
**Clara NPC Mod and Dark Side Anomen!**

---

**Project Address:** https://github.com/trow/LivingClara

This mod is a **modified and streamlined version** based on Ratatoskr and BCaesar's "All Things Mazzy", focusing exclusively on Clara's NPC content. If you want to keep Clara in your party, this mod is perfect for you!

## Project Overview

This mod streamlines content from the original Mazzy MegaMod, retaining only Clara-related components while removing all other content. It includes two main features:

### 1. Keepable Clara
Clara will no longer disappear shortly after recruitment at the Copper Coronet. We have reworked the conclusion of Hexxat's companion quest, allowing you to destroy Hexxat and save Clara permanently. 

Clara is a Female Human Lawful Evil Thief **with the ability to change her kit at any time**. Though initially weak, she can level up rapidly through numerous interjections with party members, gaining various attribute and ability bonuses. She can also be summoned directly when starting a new *Throne of Bhaal* campaign.

### 2. Dark Side Anomen: An Evil Path Expansion
If Anomen fails his paladin trial, this component adds extensive content for his Chaotic Neutral alignment. With Clara's influence, Anomen might still achieve his goal of becoming a paladin - through darker means.

## Compatibility & Installation

**Compatibility Notes:**
- Compatible with most mods
- **Do NOT install alongside the original Mazzy MegaMod** (contains duplicate content)
- Recommended to use with Banter Accelerator for better interjection frequency

**Installation Order:**
- Install after Saradas-Magic-BG2 for proper Crossmod interjections
- On EET: install before EET_End
