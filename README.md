> This is an **overhaul** of Ratatoskr and BCaesar's "All Things Mazzy", created with [authorization](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/71473/_/p46) from the original authors, for which we are very grateful.

## Project Overview

This mod includes two main features:

### 1. Keepable Clara
When facing Hexxat, Clara will no longer die. We've reworked the conclusion of Hexxat's companion quest, allowing you to permanently destroy Hexxat and save Clara.

Clara is a Female Human Lawful Evil Thief **with the ability to change her kit at any time**. Though initially underpowered, she can rapidly level up through numerous interjections with party members, gaining various attribute and ability bonuses. She can also be directly summoned when starting a new *Throne of Bhaal* campaign.

### 2. Dark Side Anomen
If Anomen fails his paladin trial, this component adds extensive content for his Chaotic Neutral alignment. With Clara's influence, Anomen might still achieve his goal of becoming a *real* paladin.

## Compatibility & Installation

**Compatibility Notes:**
- Compatible with most mods
- **Do NOT install alongside the original Mazzy MegaMod** (contains duplicate content)

**Installation Order:**
- Install after Saradas-Magic-BG2 for proper Crossmod interjections
- On EET installations: install before EET_End
- Recommended to use with Banter Accelerator for optimal interjection frequency
