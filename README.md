# Living Clara
**Clara NPC and Dark Side Anomen Expansion**

---

**Project Address:** https://github.com/trow/LivingClara 

This mod transforms Clara into a fully fleshed‑out NPC, allowing you to save her when facing Hexxat. It also expands Anomen’s dark side path with new interactions.

> This project builds upon the Clara‑related content originally created by Ratatoskr and BCaesar, and is developed with their kind [permission](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/71473/_/p46). It has been completely overhauled and expanded into a standalone mod focused solely on Clara.

## Project Overview

This mod includes two main features:

### 1. Keepable Clara
When facing Hexxat, Clara will no longer die. We've reworked the conclusion of Hexxat's companion quest, allowing you to permanently destroy Hexxat and save Clara.

Clara is a Female Human Lawful Evil Thief **with the ability to change her kit at any time**. Though initially underpowered, she can rapidly level up through numerous interjections with party members, gaining various attribute and ability bonuses. She can also be directly summoned when starting a new *Throne of Bhaal* campaign.

### 2. Dark Side Anomen
If Anomen fails his paladin trial, this component adds extensive content for his Chaotic Neutral alignment. With Clara's influence, Anomen might still achieve his goal of becoming a *real* paladin.

## Note
When encountering "Hexxat" at the Copper Coronet, the party can decline the whole thing through dialogue and never bother with it at all, or can temporarily decline and later, if desired, initiate contact and dialogue with "Hexxat" again and agree to take her to the tomb. This is identical to the original game's Hexxat quest. This must occur before Chapter 4 and will be unavailable after that time marker. So, either do it or don't by then.

## Compatibility & Installation

**Compatibility Notes:**
- Compatible with most mods
- **Do NOT install alongside the Mazzy MegaMod** (the original mod from which the Clara content was derived, as it contains duplicate material)

**Installation Order:**
- Install after Saradas-Magic-BG2 for proper Crossmod interjections
- On EET installations: install before EET_End
- Recommended to use with Banter Accelerator for optimal interjection frequency
