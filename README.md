# Living Clara
**Clara NPC Mod and Dark Side Anomen!**
---
This mod is a **modified and streamlined version** of Ratatoskr and BCaesar's "All Things Mazzy", focusing exclusively on Clara's NPC content.  
![If you want to keep Clara, this mod is perfect for you!](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/baldursgategame/images/5/5f/Clara_OHHEX_Portrait_BG2EE.png)

Created by MephistoSatanDevil with [authorization](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/71473/megamod-3-16-mazzy-romance-clara-npc-darkside-anomen-flying-aerie-for-the-evil-more-done/p46) from BCaesar and Ratatoskr.

## Project Description
This mod adapts content from Ratatoskr and BCaesar's *Mazzy MegaMod*, removing all content unrelated to Clara while retaining two main components:  
• Keepable Clara
• Dark Side Anomen

**Part 1: Keepable Clara**
Clara will no longer disappear shortly after recruitment at the Copper Coronet. We have reworked the conclusion of Hexxat's companion quest, allowing you to completely destroy Hexxat and save Clara. Clara is a Female Human Lawful Evil Thief **with the ability to change her kit at any time**. Though initially weak, she can level up rapidly through numerous interjections with party members, gaining various attribute and ability bonuses. She can also be directly summoned when starting a new *Throne of Bhaal* campaign.

**Part 2: Dark Side Anomen: An Expansion for Evil Anomen**
If Anomen fails his paladin trial, this component adds content for the Chaotic Neutral Anomen. With Clara's assistance, Anomen might yet achieve his goal of becoming a paladin.

## Compatibility & Installation  
Living Clara is compatible with most mods, but **should not** be installed alongside the original Mazzy MegaMod, as that mod already contains all content included here. Due to the extensive interjection content, we recommend using Banter Accelerator to speed up banter triggers.

Install after Saradas-Magic-BG2 to properly trigger Crossmod interjections. When installing on EET, install before EET_End, or uninstall EET_End before installation.
