![If you want to keep Clara, this mod is likely right for you!](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/baldursgategame/images/5/5f/Clara_OHHEX_Portrait_BG2EE.png)

Created by MephistoSatanDevil with [authorization](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/71473/megamod-3-16-mazzy-romance-clara-npc-darkside-anomen-flying-aerie-for-the-evil-more-done/p46) from BCaesar and Ratatoskr.

## What This Mod Is
This mod modifies Ratatoskr and BCaesar's *[Mazzy MegaMod](https://github.com/Ratatoskr589/All-Things-Mazzy)*.  
It removes the sexual content from the original mod, retaining only 3 part:  
• Keepable Clara NPC  
• Darkside Anomen  
• Bodhi NPC  


**Part 1: Keepable Clara NPC**
Clara no longer disappears shortly after recruitment at the Copper Coronet. The end of Hexxat's introductory quest have reworked ,It allowing you to **kill Hexxat to keep Clara**. Clara is a Female Human Lawful Evil Thief **with the ability to change her kit type at will**. Though initially weak, she levels up quickly, gaining stats and abilities through party banter. You may also summon Clara when starting a new *Throne of Bhaal* game.

Living Clara also includes an optional soundset for Clara from *Mazzy MegaMod* (details below).

**Part 2: Darkside Anomen**
Adds content for Chaotic Neutral Anomen if he **fails his paladin test**. This component is mostly complete and semi-optional.

**Part 3: Bodhi NPC**
Bodhi is fully functional, featuring banters, dialogues, and epilogues.  

If you direct Bodhi to accept Queen Ellesime's offer at the end of *Shadows of Amn*, **Bodhi-the-Elf** may join your party. She is a Chaotic Evil Elven Monk.

## Compatibility & Installation  
*Living Clara* is compatible with most mods **except** the original *Mazzy MegaMod*. Do **not** install both mods simultaneously, as *Mazzy MegaMod* already includes this content. If installing on EET, make sure to do so before EET_End.
